### Data/ACT_FloristicSurveys.RData
Based on data ("floristic surveys", “ACTGOV Vegetation Map 2018”, "invasive 
plant control", "PCS tracks and trails", "ACTGOV_ROAD_CENTRELINES") supplied by 
the ACT Government. Modified by retaining floristic survey and control data for 
four target weed species: Eragrostis curvula, Hypericum perforatum, Nassella 
neesiana, Nassella trichotoma. "ACTGOV Vegetation Map 2018" vegetation structure 
data were modified to identify grassland, forest or other habitat.  "PCS tracks 
and trails" data and "ACTGOV_ROAD_CENTRELINES" data were combined to derive 
distance to nearest road, track or trail.

### inst/extdata/ACT_Covariates.tif
Based on data ("ACTGOV_ROAD_CENTRELINES", "PCS tracks and trails" and "ACTGOV 
Vegetation Map 2018") supplied by the ACT Government and rasterised to grid. 
"ACTGOV Vegetation Map 2018" vegetation structure data were modified to identify 
grassland, forest or other habitat. "PCS tracks and trails" data and 
"ACTGOV_ROAD_CENTRELINES" data were combined to derive raster grid measuring the 
distance to nearest road, track or trail per 100 square metre grid cell.

### inst/extdata/ALG_DaysSinceControl.tif
Based on data ("invasive plant control") supplied by the ACT Government. 
Modified to retain only data for days since last control event for Eragrostis 
curvula.

### inst/extdata/CNG_DaysSinceControl.tif
Based on data ("invasive plant control") supplied by the ACT Government. 
Modified to retain only data for days since last control event for Nassella 
neesiana.

### inst/extdata/ST_DaysSinceControl.tif
Based on data ("invasive plant control") supplied by the ACT Government. 
Modified to retain only data for days since last control event for Nassella 
trichotoma.

### inst/extdata/SJW_DaysSinceControl.tif
Based on data ("invasive plant control") supplied by the ACT Government. 
Modified to retain only data for days since last control event for Hypericum 
perforatum.
